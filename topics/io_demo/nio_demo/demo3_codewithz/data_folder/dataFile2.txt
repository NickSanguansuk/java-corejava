call it a love song.
I’ll get the bathtub ready.
I’m in. we in ceramic.
let’s say black. I’m bp
you’re shell. we all in.
we in the black. we both in
a barrel. call it a village.
we both in the pumping. the people
no get no nothing. no crabs in the river.
no periwinkles to pick. no day
de pas where they no dey cry
suffer this kind suffer like this. we no care
for them. I just want you to seep.
blacken my lot.
